\noindent\textbf{Event.}

\noindent\textbf{Trace.}
The execution of an app on a sequence of user inputs can be denoted by a trace of the form
$s_0\xrightarrow{e_1, D_1}s_1\xrightarrow{e_2, D_2}s_2 \cdots\xrightarrow{e_n, D_n}s_n$.
Each $s_i$ is a concrete state of the Android app.
Each $D_i$ is an image decoding API invocation sequence. Each image decoding API invocation $d_i$ in $D$ is a pair $(a,b)$, $a$ denotes the image decoding API name, $b$ denotes the returned bitmap object value of the image decoding API invocation.
Each $s_{i-1}\xrightarrow{e_i, D_i}s_i$ denotes that the Android app transitioned from state $s_{i-1}$ to state $s_i$ on event $e_i$ and induced the sequence of image decoding API invocations $D_i$ during the transition.

\noindent\textbf{Loop.}
A sub-trace forms a loop if it begins and ends with the same abstract state, computed by abstracting the concrete state of the Android app based on information from the GUI component tree.
For example,
