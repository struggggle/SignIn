Paper name: 
Rousillon: Scraping Distributed Hierarchical Web Data (UIST'16)


Research problem:
How to implement a programming system for writing complex web automation scripts by demonstration and this scripts have the capability to collect hierarchically- structured data from across many different webpages.



Contributions:
For the domain of data-access web scraping, the first PBD tool that synthesizes programs with loops and the first PBD tool that collects distributed hierarchical data.


Approach overview:
Given a demonstration of how to collect a row of the joined data, our custom synthesizer produces a scraping program with one loop for each level of the data hierarchy. A Relation Selector algorithm leverages common web design patterns to find relations (e.g., movies, actors, cities, restaurants, reviews). A Generalizer algorithm produces a loop for iterating over each relation. This lets our approach introduce arbitrarily nested loops without user intervention.
