Paper name: 
TCM: Test Case Mutation to Improve Crash Detection in Android (FASE'18)


Research problem:
How to mutate existing test cases to produce richer test cases in order to increase the number of detected crashes?


Insight:
Guided by typical crash patterns that exist in Android applications to perform mutation operators on existing test cases.


Contributions:
This paper defines six mutation operators on Android test cases to uncover new crashes.


Approach overview:

This paper first identifies typical crash patterns that exist in Android applications. Then, it develops mutation operators based on these crash patterns. 
Typical crash patterns in Android are Unhandled Exceptions, External Errors, Resource Unavailability, Semantic Errors, and Network-Based Crashes. This paper defines six novel mutation operators (Loop-Stressing, Pause-Resume, Change Text, Toggle Contextual State, Remove Delays, and Faster Swipe) and relate them to these five crash patterns.
