Paper name: 
A Guided Genetic Algorithm for Automated Crash Reproduction (ICSE'17)


Research problem:
How to reproduce real-world crashes?


Contributions:
A novel guided genetic algorithm (GGA) for crash reproduction that generates and evolves only tests that exercise at least one of the methods involved in the failure;

Insight:
It lets the stack trace guide the search, thus reducing the search space.


Approach overview:
GGA contains all main steps of a standard genetic algorithm: (i) it starts with creation of an initial population of random tests; (ii) it evolves such tests over subsequent generations using crossover and mutation; and (iii) at each generation it selects the fittest tests according to the fitness function. The main difference is represented by the fact that it uses (i) a novel routine for generating the initial population (line 5); (ii) a new crossover operator; (iii) a new mutation operator. Finally, the fittest test obtained at the end of the search is optimized by post-processing.
