Paper name: 
Systematic Execution of Android Test Suites in Adverse Conditions (ISSTA'15)


Research problem:
How to generate test cases that can test apps under adverse conditions?


Insight:
Injecting special events in existing tests to check the robustness of apps in adverse conditions. 

Contributions:
A methodology for leveraging existing tests to detect bugs that involve unexpected events.



Approach overview:
Given a set of test cases T and a list of neutral event sequences N, we execute each test in T using a modified testing framework that injects every event sequence from N (in the given order) at every injection point. In other words, we combine all the event sequences in N into one neutral event sequence (neutral event sequences are trivially closed under concatenation) and inject it aggressively.
