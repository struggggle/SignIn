Paper name: 
Minimizing GUI Event Traces (FSE'16)


Research problem:
Given a large event trace, how to find a minimal subtrace that reachs the same activity?


Insight:
Identifying and removing some common forms of redundancies introduced by existing automated GUI testing tools.


Contributions:
This paper defines the subtrace selection problem and provide an efficient heuristic, as well as an optimal solution based on the problem’s characterization as a Markov Decision Pro- cess (MDP).


Approach overview:

This approach applies delta debugging that starts with a large input sequence that passes a particular test oracle and attempts to remove part of the sequence at every step, such that the remaining subtrace still passes the oracle. This approach is repeated until  have a 1-minimal subtrace that is accepted by the oracle. A 1-minimal subtrace with property P satisfies P, but removing any single element does not satisfy P.
For the minimization process, this approach checks whether subtraces of a trace still reach the desired state. This approach defines the subtrace selection problem and provide an efficient heuristic, as well as an optimal solution based on the problem’s characterization as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
