Paper name: 
Monkey See, Monkey Do: Effective Generation of GUI Tests with Inferred Macro Events (ISSTA'16)


Research problem:
How to create complex sequences of events that represent realistic user interactions?


Insight:
Exploiting execution traces of human users to automatically create complex sequences of events that represent logical steps as perceived by a user.


Contributions:
The approach introduces macro events, which summarize sequences of UI events into logical steps that users commonly perform. Then, this paper applies them to generate UI-level tests that trigger complex, realistic sequences of events.


Approach overview:

First, the approach gathers execution traces from the interactions of human users with a program. Such traces can be gathered, e.g., during manual pre-deployment testing or via lightweight, distributed sampling of user interactions with a deployed program. 
Second, the approach identifies recurring patterns in the usage traces and summarizes them into an FSM-based description. Each such pattern, called a macro event, represents one logical step of using the program. 
Third, the approach automatically generates tests, i.e., sequences of UI events, through a combination of random testing and applying the inferred macro events.
